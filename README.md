LLM Packet Analyzer is a Python tool that converts PCAP files into structured JSON data and leverages a local LM Studio LLM API to provide detailed technical analyses of network packets. The output is a training dataset ideal for fine-tuning or instructing your local LLM on network packet analysis, anomaly detection, and cybersecurity insights.
